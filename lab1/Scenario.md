# Scenario
There is a small company with developing team and operations team doing a startup. Development processes are manual, from code sharing to testing and deployment. The code is shared by sending script files from workers of the development side to workers from the operations side. The tests are done manually, they are time-consuming and error-prone. The code may not be consistent between developers and operations workers. Manual code building brings delay in getting the code to production. Developers and operations teams work on different environments, causing discrepancies between testing and production.

# How DevOps can help
- **Automation.** The startup can implement DevOps automation practices, including CI/CD pipelines. These pipelines automate code building, testing, and deployment, reducing errors and accelerating the delivery process.
- **Collaboration.** The development and operations teams form cross-functional teams. By adopting version control system, they collaborate collaborate efficiently and synchronize code versions.
- **Containerization.** The team can adopt containerization using Docker. Applications and their dependencies are packaged into containers, ensuring that they run consistently across various environments.

# Benefits of DevOps
- **Faster development.** The implementation of CI/CD pipeline allows the development team to deliver new features and bug fixes more quickly and reliably.
- **Consistency across environments.** Containerization ensures that development, testing, and production environments are consistent.
- **Consistency across code versions.** The developers and operations teams syncronize code versions. This consistency reduces confusion and integration challenges.
