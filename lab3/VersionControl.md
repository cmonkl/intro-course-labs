# Version control systems
Version control systems are software tools that help developers track and manage changes to their codebase, documents, or any other set of files over time. 

# Benefits and advantages of using version control in a collaborative environment
- Versioning: tracking who made what changes allows to revert to previous versions if needed.

- Branching and merging: version control systems allow developers to create branches to work on specific features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Later, they can merge these branches back into the main codebase.

- Conflict resolution: version control systems provide tools for detecting and resolving conflicts when two or more developers make conflicting changes to the same file.

- Backup and recovery: the centralized or distributed nature of VCS systems helps in disaster recovery and backup of project data.

- Code review: version control systems can facilitate code review processes, allowing team members to comment on and discuss code changes before they are merged into the main codebase.

# Types of version control systems
- Centralized version control systems: in a centralized system there is a single central repository that stores the entire project's codebase and its history. Multiple developers access this central repository to check out files, make changes, and commit those changes back into the repository. 

- Distributed version control systems: in a distributed system each developer maintains a complete copy of the project's repository including its entire history on their local machine. 
 
# Comparison 
## Git
- distributed version control system
- branching and merging
- fast performance

## Subversion
- centralized version control system
- check out and check in code to the central repository
- slower performance

## Mercurial
- distributed version control system
- branching and merging
- faster performance compared with Subversion but not with Git
