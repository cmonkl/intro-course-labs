# Software distribution 
Software distribution is the procedure of delivering software applications or updates to users.
The significance of software distribution is providing secure and efficient way for packaging, deploying and tracking software changes in the enterprise while reaching to the target audience. 

# Software distribution strategies
### App stores
Delivering through centralized online platforms (app stores). For example, App Store, Google Play Store  are platforms where users can browse, download and install software applications onto their devices.

Key characteristics:
- centralized distribution
- user-friendly interfaces
- automatic updates
- monetization options
- global reachability

### Cloud-based deployment
Delivering, hosting and accessing the applications over the internet from cloud computing infrastructure. Instead of running software on local servers or individual devices, cloud-based deployment leverages remote data centers and resources provided by cloud service providers. Examples of cloud-based deployment platforms: Microsoft Azure, AWS CodeDeploy, etc.

Key characteristics:
- scalability
- accessibility
- automatic updates
- reduced hardware maintenance

### Package managers
Delivering applications in packages, which are archive files containing software and associated data. Package managers are used to automate the installation, configuration, upgrading, and removal of such software packages. Examples: APT, YUM, etc.

Key characteristics:
- consistency
- version control
- dependency resolution
- automatic updates

### Web downloads
Distributing software by providing a direct link to download the software package directly from a website or server.

# Best practices
- use version control
- collect and analyse user feedback
- add security measures
- provide clear documentation and support channels
- automate deployment and deliver regular updates
